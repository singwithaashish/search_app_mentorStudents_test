## notes
- I used mongodb atlas for the database
- I used react and css for the frontend

## working
- The mongoDB backend contains 2 collections, one for company and another for ads
- The company collection contains the company name and the company URL
- The ads collection contains the company id, primary text, headline, description, CTA & image URL 
- The frontend also has a search bar which can be used to search for a company by the keywords in the ad's texts
- The backend is NodeJS and Express and the frontend is ReactJS
